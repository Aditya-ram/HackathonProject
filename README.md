# React + Vite


Currently, two official plugins are available:
- It is a project containing two web pages.
- The first webpage contains a list of repositories given by the github search API.
- The owner of the repository, description, star count, fork count, and primary language are also displayed.
- Repositories can be filtered based on language.
- They can be sorted based on either the star counts or the fork counts.
- Clicking on any displayed repo leads you to a new page that displays the recent commits and the contributors to that repository.
- The webpage can operate on two themes/modes: dark and light.
